## 3. `Cart`

### Responsibility

Manages the items in the cart and calculates the cart's total and final total after applying a discount strategy.

### Data it holds

### Main methods

* `__construct()` — initializes the cart with a discount strategy.
* `addItem()` — adds a `CartItem` to the cart.
* `getTotal()` — calculates the total of all cart items.
* `getFinalTotal()` — applies the discount strategy to the cart total.

### Responsibility that does **not** belong to it

## 4. `DiscountStrategy` (Interface)

### Responsibility

It defines the common contract/implementation schema that every discount strategy must follow.

### Data it holds

* Doesn't hold any data.

### Main methods

* `apply(float $total): float` — defines how a discount strategy transforms the total.

### Responsibility that does **not** belong to it

* It does not perform a specific discount calculation itself.

---

## 5. `NoDiscount`

### Responsibility

It represents a discount strategy when no discount is applied.

### Data it holds

* Doesn't hold any data.

### Main methods

## 6. `PercentageDiscount`

### Responsibility

It applies a percentage-based discount to a total value.
